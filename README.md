## Smart traffic light system
<img class="pull-right"  src="https://github.com/SabiSabb/Games/blob/main/Picture1.png?raw=true" style="float:right" align="right" width="400">
The aim of this application was to implement a method of decongestion by adapting the sequence of traffic lights to current traffic conditions. This was achieved by using artificial intelligence algorithms. The application also offers the possibility to test real traffic scenarios by retrieving real traffic data from real intersections and simulating them in a realistic 3D environment. By simulating the data, the app provides and enforces the best traffic light policy that minimizes traffic light waiting time and maximizes the number of cars passing through the intersection. The 3D environment was designed in Unity 3D, the behavior has been defined by C# scripts and the simulation and artificial intelligence algorithms were developed in Python.
